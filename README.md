# Image-Object-Localization-
This is a Object Localization problem in which we find what the object is in the image(image classification) and where the object is present in the image and draw bounding boxes(Object Localization).It involves both classification and regression problems.

Image classification involves predicting the class of one object in an image. **Object localization** refers to identifying the location of one or more objects in an image and drawing abounding box around their extent. Object detection combines these two tasks and localizes and classifies one or more objects in an image.
